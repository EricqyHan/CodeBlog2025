Did my four mile run in about 48 minutes on Friday morning. I could have definitely ran faster. I also went to MMA today and did another 2.5 mile run a few hours after. I have now signed up for a 10K in April, another Half-Marathon in May, the Half-Marathon in San Diego in June with Norbert, and hopefully NYC in November.
