My goals for 2025 are listed below with dates I like to complete them by. Plan on adding a lot to them

Get weight under 200 pounds by mid February and under 180 by Half-Marathon time on June 1. 
Currently at 208
Average a 12 minute mile for 3 miles by end of January. 
I can't believe how long it has been since I actually ran. 
Code a lot more this year. 
Actually work on my coding ideas.
