I finally got the categories to go in order. Realized it was originally working because it was setting the uppercase letters first and the lower case after everything that was uppercase. Didn't realize it originally because I set Tailwind to display them with the first letter as uppercase on the site. I finally realized this when I saw the logs and read my code. I saw that 2025, ESC (Every Second Counts), and MAC were stuff I left as uppercase and they were getting put to the front of the list. I "fixed" this by making everything lowercase.
