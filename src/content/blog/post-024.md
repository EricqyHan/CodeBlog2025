It's April 1st. I have my 10K on in six days. I should start coding more and build something cool.

It has been a minute. My last post was seven months ago and I talked about my 10k. I have completed another two half-marathons and the NYC Marathon since April. This year is coming to an end and I have learned that anything is possible with a lot of dedication. Hoping to do it again next year while working hard on my coding journey.
